#summary Rules, formatting and otherwise, for project code.

= Formatting =

  * Two-space indents.
    * Code which was translated from other languages (E, Java) may have the original four-space indenting. This should be corrected as time permits.
  * Do not omit semicolons in !JavaScript. Do omit semicolons in E.
  * Blank lines inside indented blocks shall be equally indented.
  * Do not hard-wrap paragraphs. 
  * Do not stick to 80 columns unless it looks good that way.

= File naming =

  * Files containing many definitions/tests on a general topic area (modules) shall have lowercase names with hyphens.
  * Files defining a particular class/constructor shall have the same name as that class (typically capitalized).
