This is Caja-CapTP.

--- Building

To build it you will need Google Caja, downloaded or symlinked to caja/.

Run "make".

--- Testing

To run the tests you will need E-on-JavaScript (and therefore E-on-Java), built (see its readme file) and symlinked to eojs/. 

Run "make test"; the test files should open in your web browser. As well as the progress bar at the top, each test case has a bar to the left of it: dashed is not-yet-run, gray is successful, and red is unsuccessful.
